    <p> I created this website during the quaratine of COVID-19.  I wanted to share my photos and other thoughts that I had during this unprecedented time. </br>
        I will (hopefully) maintain this website in the future and keep uploading neat (at least to me!) photos and have fun in making this website. </p>
